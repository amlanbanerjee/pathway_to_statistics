The chapter introduces two main types of statistical studies, namely observational studies and experiments. Also discussed here are their benefits and drawbacks and how to design them well. 2.1 Variable In statistics, a variable is a characteristics of the individuals to be measured or observed. Types of Variables 1. CATEGORICAL (or QUALITATIVE) - consist of names or labels (not numbers that represent counts or measurements) - Nominal (unordered): the data fall into categories that have no particular order or ranking in relation to each other, e.g., color (blue, green, red,), gender (male, female), nationality (American, Canadian, Mexican,) - Ordinal (ordered): values have a natural order to ranking, e.g., temperature (low, medium, high), exam grade (A, B, C, D, F), satisfaction (high, neutral, low) 2. NUMERICAL (or QUANTITATIVE) - consist of numbers representing measurements or counts. - Continuous: a subject or observation takes a value from an interval of real numbers, e.g., weight, height, age, etc. - Discrete: a subject or observation takes certain values from a finite set, e.g. population, traffic volume, etc. Continuous and discrete variables can be further categorized as either interval or ratio variables. Interval Variables: these variables are measured along a continuum, and they have the property that equal differences between measures represent equal differences in the values of the variable. For example, temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. So the difference between \\(20^\\circ C\\) and \\(30^\\circ C\\) is the same as \\(30^\\circ C\\) to \\(40^\\circ C\\). However, temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit is NOT a ratio variable. Ratio Variables: these variables have all the properties of interval variables, but in addition have the property that the ratio variable has a meaningful absolute zero. For example, temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit is not a ratio variable because \\(0^\\circ C\\) does not mean there is no temperature. Other examples of ratio variables include height, mass, distance and many more. The name ratio reflects the fact that you can use the ratio of measurements. So, for example, a distance of ten meters is twice the distance of \\(5\\) meters. 2.2 Statistics Statistical studies are designed by the following five steps: Raise a precise question about one or more variables. Design a plan to answer the question. Collect the data. Analyze the data. Draw a conclusion from the data about the question. 2.3 Data Collection The first step in conducting research is to identify topics or questions that are to be investigated. A clearly laid out research question is helpful in identifying what subjects or cases should be studied and what variables are important. It is also important to consider how data are collected so that they are reliable and help achieve the research goals. The Goal Learn about the entire group of individuals The Problem It is usually impossible to collect data on the entire population expensive time consuming impossible to find everyone not everyone willing to participate population changing constantly - births and deaths The Compromise Collect data on a smaller group of individuals selected from the population The Challenge Bias (double-counting and under-counting) 2.4 Sampling from a Population Population is the complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered. Typically, a population is the complete collection of data that we would like to make inference about. Census is the collection of data from every member of the population. Sampling Frame is a numbered list of all the individuals in the population from which a sample is drawn. Sample is a subcollection of members selected from a population. Because populations are often very large, a common objective of the use of statistics is to obtain data from a sample and then use those data to form a conclusion about the population. Example: Identify the Variable, Sample, and Population of a Study In a poll of \\(1000\\) randomly selected American adults, \\(48\\%\\) of respondents said that they strongly disapprove of the way Congress is doing its job. The study then made an inference about all American adults. Define the variable of the study. Identify the sample. Identify the population. 2.5 Statistical Inference Inferential Statistics is the practice of using information from a sample to draw conclusions about the entire population. It is the process of making judgments about the parameters of a population and the reliability of statistical relationships, typically on the basis of random sampling. \\(\\require{AMScd}\\) \\[ \\begin{CD} Sample @&gt; {\\text {statistical inference}} &gt;&gt; Population \\end{CD} \\] \\[\\underbrace{\\text {sample statistics}}_{\\text{investigator knows}} = \\underbrace{\\text {population parameter}}_{\\text{investigator wants to know}} + \\underbrace{\\text {bias}}_{\\text{nonsampling error}} + \\underbrace{\\text {chance variation}}_{\\text{random sampling error}} \\] 2.6 Sampling Errors RANDOM SAMPLING ERROR - occurs when the sample has been selected with a random method, but there is a discrepancy between a sample result and the true population result. NONSAMPLING ERROR - is the results of human error, including such factors as wrong data entries, computing errors, questions with biased wording, false data provided by respondents, forming biased conclusions, or applying statistical methods that are not appropriate for the circumstances. A sampling method that consistently underestimates or overestimates some characteristics of the population is said to be biased. Selection/Sampling bias - occurs when the sample is selected in such a way that it systematically excludes or underrepresented part of the population. An online survey conducted to estimate the percentage of Americans who have a Facebook account. The survey is biased because people who go online are favored. People who never go online cannot participate in the poll. Nonresponse bias - occurs when responses are not obtained from all individuals selected for inclusion in a sample. It happens if individuals refuse to be part of the study or if the research cannot track down individuals identified to be in the sample. Measurement or response bias - occurs when the data are collected in such a way that it tends to result in observed values that are different from the actual value in some systematic way. Contributing factors: question wording and order; mode of survey; influence of the interviewer; people might exaggerate how much money they earn; or a researcher might record the information incorrectly etc. Response bias can also result from the wording of questions. For example, compare the impact of the following two questions: Do you brag about your past successes with others? Do you inspire others by sharing your past successes? Do you share your past successes with others? NONRANDOM SAMPLING ERROR - is the results of using a sampling method that is not random, such as using a convenience sample or a voluntary response sample. 2.7 Bias and Precision Bias The average difference between the estimator and the true value. Precision The standard deviation of the estimator. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Mean Squared Error, MSE} &amp;= precision^2 + bias^2 \\\\ \\text{Root Mean Squared Error, RMSE} &amp;= \\sqrt{MSE} \\end{aligned} \\] 2.8 Parameter and Statistic A parameter is a numerical measurement describing some characteristics of a population. A statistic is a numerical measurement describing some characteristics of a sample. Example: There are \\(17,246,372\\) high school students in the U.S. In a study of \\(8505\\) U.S. high school students \\(16\\) years of age or older, \\(44.5\\%\\) of them said that they texted while driving at least once during the previous \\(30\\) days. Parameter: What percent of the population texted while driving? (unknown) Statistic: \\(44.5\\%\\) Exercise 2.1 10, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48 2.9 Simple Random Sampling (SRS) A simple random sample of n subjects is selected in such a way that every possible sample of the sample size n has the same chance of being chosen. In statistics a sample of a population is said to be random if each member in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. Sampling with replacement - an individual is selected more than once. Sampling without replacement - an individual is selected only once. Source: OpenIntro.Org 2.10 Stratified Sampling The population is divided into non-overlapping, homogeneous subgroups called strata . Then, SRS is employed to select a certain number or a certain proportion of the whole within each stratum.

Cluster sampling is much like SRS, but instead of randomly selecting individuals, SRS is applied to select clusters. In other words, unlike stratified sampling, cluster sampling is most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves dont look very different from one another. That is, we expect strata to be self-similar (homogeneous), while we expect clusters to be diverse (heterogeneous). The elements in each cluster are then sampled. If all elements in each sampled cluster are sampled, then this is referred to as a one-stage cluster sampling plan. Sometimes cluster sampling can be a more economical random sampling technique than the alternatives. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, this sampling method works best when each neighborhood is very diverse. Because each neighborhood itself encompasses diversity, a cluster sample can reduce the time and cost associated with data collection, because the interviewer would need only go to some of the neighborhoods rather than to all parts of a city, in order to collect a useful sample. One-Stage Cluster Sampling Source: OpenIntro.Org Multistage Cluster Sampling A multistage or multistage cluster sampling is an extention of cluster sampling and involves two (or more) steps. First step is to take a cluster sample. Then, instead of including all of the individuals in these clusters in the sample, a second sampling method, usually SRS, is employed within each of the selected clusters. In the neighborhood example, we could first randomly select some number of neighborhoods and then take a SRS from just those selected neighborhoods. As seen in Figure, stratified sampling requires observations to be sampled from every stratum. Multistage sampling selects observations only from those clusters that were randomly selected in the first step. It is also possible to have more than two steps in multistage sampling. Each cluster may be naturally divided into subclusters. For example, each neighborhood could be divided into streets. To take a three-stage sample, we could first select some number of clusters (neighborhoods), and then, within the selected clusters, select some number of subclusters (streets). Finally, we could select some number of individuals from each of the selected streets. Source: OpenIntro.Org 2.12 Nonrandom Sampling Systematic Sampling Select every \\(k^{th}\\) individual froma list of the population, where the position of the first person chosen is randomly selected from the \\(k\\) individuals. This will give a non-representative sample if there is a structure to the list. Source: OpenIntro.Org Solve: The human resource department at a certain company wants to conduct a survey regarding worker benefits. The department has an alphabetical list of all \\(5465\\) employees at the company and wants to conduct a systematic sample of size \\(60\\). What is \\(k\\)? Determine the individuals who will be administered the survey. Randomly select a number from \\(1\\) to \\(k\\). Suppose that we randomly select \\(10\\). Starting with the first individual selected, the individuals in the survey will be Convenience or Volunteer Sampling Use the first \\(n\\) individuals that are available or the individuals who volunteer to participate. This is almost sure to give a non-representative sample which cannot be generalized to the population. Example: Non-Representative Sample Survey Surveyed 10 million people who were subcribers or had telephones. 2.4 million people responded (i.e. 24% response rate) Prediction Landslide victory of Landon. Election Result Landslide victory of Roosevelt. What did go wrong with the poll? Sample was drawn from telephone directories, club membership, magazine subscibers, etc. who were upper middle class people, largely excluding poor unemployed people. The sample suffered from both selection and nonresponse bias. Exercise: Identifying Sampling Methods A researcher randomly selects 20 Taco Bell locations and surveys all the employees at those locations. A news station hosts a call-in survey about whether physician-assisted death should be legalized in all states. A researcher randomly selects an LED TV out of the first 200 LED TVs on an assembly line and also selects every 200th LED TV after that. In a study at a community college, 30 instructors are randomly selected from fulltime instructors and 50 instructors are selected from part-time instructors. The City Hall of Spring Hill, Kansas, creates a frame of its 5730 residents and randomly selects 60 residents. 2.13 Explanatory and Response Variables In statistical studies, we want to know whether a variable \\(x\\) explains (or affects) another variables \\(y\\). The \\(x\\) variable is called the explanatory or independent variable. The \\(y\\) variable is called the response or dependent variable. Association vs. Causation There is an association between an explanatory and response variable when the response variable changes as the explanatory variable changes. If the change in the explanatory variable causes the change in the response variable, then there is a causation between the variables. 2.14 Observational Studies Generally, data in observational studies are collected on specific characteristics only by passively monitoring study participants, but the observers dont attempt to modify the individuals being studied. These studies are inexpensive and good for discovering relationships related to rare outcomes. They are generally only sufficient to show associations. Types of observational studies: 1. Cross-sectional Studies - data are observed, measured, and collected at one point in time, not over a period of time. 2. Retrospective Studies - data are collected from a past time period by going back in time (through examinations of records, interviews, and so on). 3. Prospective (or longitudinal or cohort) Studies - data are collected in the future from groups that share common factors (such groups are called cohorts). Case Study 1: why did Fido and Fluffy die? Early 2007, many dogs and cats died of kidney failure. Should you conduct a retrospective or prospective study to find out why? Retrospective Studies could be appropriate since The event happened in the past. It may have been a rare event. The retrospective study may provide clues on the cause. Once possible causes are identified, try a Prospective Studies to verify the causes - if it doesnt kill any pets.

Sample Size: 400,000 Age Range: 50-71 years Period: 1995 - 2008 Death: 52,000 How would you interpret the result? 2.15 Confounding Variable A confounding variable is a variable that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables. Simultaneously with the explanatory variable, it may cause the response variable to change during the study. Because of the confounding variables association with both variables, we do not know if the response is due to the explanatory variable or due to the confounding variable. Sun exposure is a confounding factor because it is associated with both the use of sunscreen and the development of skin cancer. People who are out in the sun all day are more likely to use sunscreen, and people who are out in the sun all day are more likely to get skin cancer. 2.16 Lurking Variable Lurking variables are variables that are not considered in the analysis, but may affect the nature of the relationship between the explanatory variable and the outcome. Table: 20-year survival status of women by smoking status \\[ \\begin{array}{c|lcr} &amp; \\text{Smoker} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Yes} &amp; \\text{No} \\\\ \\hline \\text {Dead} &amp; 0.239 &amp; 0.314 \\\\ \\text {Alive} &amp; 0.761 &amp; 0.686 \\end{array} \\] Are smokers less likely to die? 2.17 Experimental Design While observational studies are effective tools for answering certain research questions, experiments are essential to measure the effect of a treatment. In an experiment, we apply some treatment and then proceed to observe its effects on the individuals. Subject: Entity who is participating in the study. Treatment Group: The group of subjects that receives treatments. Control Group: The group of subjects that receives no treatment. Response Variable: The outcome of interest, measured on each subject. Factor: The categorical variable that explains the outcome of the experiment. Each category is called level. Blinding: When researchers keep the subjects uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be blind. Its purpose is to reduce the potential for both researchers and subjects emotional bias. Subjects would not know which experimental group they are assigned to. The researcher (i.e. the person who is measuring the outcome) would not know which treatment is assigned to which experimental unit. Single-blind: only one type of blinding is applied. Double-blind: both types of blinding are applied. Placebo: A substance or treatment with no active ingredients. The control group receives the placebo treatment. This phenomenon, in which the recipient perceives an improvement in condition due to personal expectations, rather than the treatment itself, is known as the placebo effect. Principles of Experimental Design Well-conducted experiments are built on three main principles. Direct Control Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to control any other differences in the groups. They want the groups to be as identical as possible except for the treatment, so that at the end of the experiment any difference in response between the groups can be attributed to the treatment and not to some other confounding or lurking variable. Direct control refers to variables that the researcher can control, or make the same. Randomization Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out the effects of such differences, and it also prevents accidental bias from entering the study. Replication In a single study, replication is done by imposing the treatment on a sufficiently large number of subjects or experimental units. Scientists may also replicate the entire experiment on an entirely different population of experimental units to verify earlier findings. 2.18 Randomized and Blocked Design A completely randomized experiment is one in which the subjects or experimental units are randomly assigned to each group in the experiment. Researchers sometimes know or suspect that another variable, other than the treatment, influences the response. Under these circumstances, they may carry out a blocked experiment. In this design, they first group individuals into blocks based on the identified variable and then randomize subjects within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is referred to as blocking.

Individuals should be randomly assigned to the control and treatment group(s). The sample size should be large enough. A placebo should be used when appropriate. The study should be double-blind when possible. If this is impossible, then the study should be single-blind if possible. Practice: Identifying an Experiment and an Observational Study Identify whether the study is an experiment or an observational study. Discuss whether the components of a good study were used. For five years, the author taught an innovative intermediate algebra course in which students learned by working in groups. Then the author compared the proportion of his successful intermediate algebra students who passed trigonometry with the proportion of other professors successful intermediate algebra students who passed trigonometry. Practice: Redesign an Observational Study into a Well-Designed Experiment A researcher wants to determine whether taking vitamin C helps people avoid getting the flu and the common cold. She randomly selects 100 people and asks them whether they take vitamin C and how often they had the flu or a cold in the past year. The researcher analyzes the responses and concludes that vitamin C helps people avoid the flu and colds. Describe some problems with the observational study. Include in your description at least one possible lurking or confounding variable and identify which type it is. Redesign the study so that it is a well-designed experiment.

The results of the survey are described by the multiple bar graph. What proportion of women thought of themselves as Democrats? Which political party did the greatest proportion of men choose? Compare the proportion of women who thought of themselves as Independents to the proportion of men who thought of themselves as Independents.

The higher the stack of dots, the greater the number of occurrences there are of the corresponding value. Interpreting Dotplot What observation occurred the most? What observations occured the least? How many emails have 25 or more characters? Do you see any outliers? Definitions The frequency of an observation of a numerical variable is the number of times the observation occurs in the group of data. The frequency distribution of a numerical variable is the observations together with their frequencies. An outlier is an observation that is quite a bit smaller or larger than the other observations. The kth percentile of some data is a value (not necessarily a data value) that is greater than or equal to approximately k% of the observations and is less than approximately (100 - k)% of the observations. Example: Percentiles Find the percentile of 22. Find the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile. 3.6 Stemplots A stemplot (or stem-and-leaf plot) breaks up each data value into two parts: leaf, which is the rightmost digit, and the stem, which is the other digits. 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 7 7 7 9 9 9 10 10 10 11 11 12 14 14 16 17 22 25 25 25 26 26 27 29 42 43 64 The decimal point is 1 digit(s) to the right of the | 0 | 00000011111223334455566777999 1 | 0001124467 2 | 25556679 3 | 4 | 23 5 | 6 | 4 3.7 Histogram A histogram is a graph consisting of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other. The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values; and the vertical scale represents frequencies.

We calculate the cumulative relative frequency starting from class \\(text{0-10}\\) until we reach the desired percentile.

In this chapter, we will numerically describe distributions of quantitative variables. Distributions, such as histograms, can be described by three characteristics: shape, center, and spread. 4.1 Measures of Shape Modes The mode of some data is an observation with the greatest frequency. There can be more than one mode, but if all the observations have frequency 1, then there is no mode. Mode is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. Unimodel Distribution Bimodal Distribution Multimodal Distribution Uniform Distribution All the bins have the same frequency, or at least close to the same frequency. It is a distribution without a mode. Symmetry The histogram for a symmetric distribution will look the same on the left and the right of its center. Skew A histogram is skewed right if the longer tail is on the right side of the mode. A histogram is skewed left if the longer tail is on the left side of the mode. Outlier An Outlier is a data value that is far above or far below the rest of the data values. 4.2 Measures of Center MEAN The sample mean of a numerical variable is computed as the sum of all of the observations \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}\\) divided by the number of observations \\((n)\\). If \\(\\bar x\\) is the mean, then \\[ \\displaystyle (\\bar x - x_1) + (\\bar x - x_2) + \\cdots + (\\bar x - x_n) = 0 \\\\ \\displaystyle \\text{Therefore}, \\ \\bar x = \\frac{(x_1+x_2+...+x_n)}{n} = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\] The mean follows the tail In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median. In a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. In a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are approximately equal. MEDIAN The median splits an ordered data set in half. If there are an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. If there are an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value.

How the Shape of a Distribution Affects the Mean and the Median If a distribution is skewed left, the mean is usually less than the median and the median is usually a better measure of the center. If a distribution is symmetric, the mean is approximately equal to the median and both are reasonable measures of the center. If a distribution is skewed right, the mean is usually greater than the median and the median is usually a better measure of the center. List: \\({2,3,3,4}\\) List: \\(2,3,3,7\\) Notice: The median is unaffected by outlier. Weighted Mean The weighted mean is the same as the mean, except that it is influenced more by some observations than others. We assign weights to observations as a sort of way of describing its relative importance. The weighted mean of observations \\(x_1, x_2,...,x_n\\) using weights \\(w_1, w_2,...,w_n\\) is given by \\(\\displaystyle \\bar x =\\frac{w_1x_1+w_2x_2+...+w_nx_n}{w_1+w_2+...+w_n}\\) The simple mean is a weighted mean where all the weights are 1. \\(\\displaystyle \\bar x =\\frac{1\\times x_1+1\\times x_2+...+1\\times x_n}{1+1+...+1} = \\frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}\\) Midrange The midrange of a data set is the measure of center that is the value midway between the maximum and minimum values in the original data set. It is found by adding the maximum data value to the minimum data value and then dividing the sum by \\(2\\), as the following formula: \\[ Midrange = \\frac{\\text{maximum data value + minimum data value}}{2} \\] 4.3 Measures of Spread or Variation RANGE The range of a set of data is the difference between the maximum and the minimum data values. \\(range = maximum - minimum\\) The range is sensitive to outliers. A single high or low value will affect the range significantly. STANDARD DEVIATION OF A SAMPLE SD \\((s)\\) of a set of sample values is a measure of how much, on average, the data values deviate away from the sample mean. In other word, SD describes the variability of the data set within the range of the dataset. Low variability or small spread means that the values tend to be more clustered together. High variability or large spread means that the values tend to be far apart. Calculating the Standard Deviation The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is roughly the average distance of the observations from the mean. \\[ \\bbox[yellow,5px] { \\color{black}{s= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum(x_i-\\bar x)^2}} } \\] Exercise: \\(1.

COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION The coefficient of variation (CV) for a set of nonnegative sample or population data, expressed as a percent, describes the standard deviation relative to the mean, and is given by the following: \\[ Sample: CV = \\frac{s}{x}.100 \\\\ Population: CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{x}.100 \\] 4.4 Normal Distribution | 68-95-99.7 Rule Probabilities for falling 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.

In this chapter, we will extend the concept of relative frequencies to understand and calculate the probability of occurrence of a random event. We will also learn about normal distribution, its properties, and methods to calculate probabilities of random events that are described by this distribution. 5.1 Meaning of Probability An event is Random if individual outcomes of it are unpredictable, meaning they have no apparent pattern of occurrence, but there is nonetheless a predictable distribution (i.e. the frequencies) of those different outcomes over a large number of repetitions of the event. The Probability of any outcome of a random event can be defined as the proportion of times the outcome would occur in a very long series of repetitions. The probability is defined as a proportion, and it always takes values between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) (inclusively). It may also be displayed as a percentage between \\(0\\%\\) and \\(100\\%\\). \\(0\\%: \\text{event is impossible}\\) \\(100\\%: \\text{event is certain}\\) The sample space of a random experiment is the group of all possible outcomes. For example, in the roll of a dice, if we are interested in finding the probability of observing \\(1\\) from the set of all of possible odd numbers, then the sample space consists of the set \\(\\{ 1, 2, 3\\}.\\) The event is some of the outcomes in the sample space, all of them, or none of them. For example, in the roll of a dice, if we are interested in finding the probability of observing an even number, then the event is described by the set of outcomes \\(\\{ 2, 4, 6\\}\\). THEORETICAL VERSUS EXPERIMENTAL PROBABILITY The Theoretical probability is the likelihood of occurring of an event. It is simply the ratio of the number of desired outcomes and the number of all possible outcomes. The experimental probability is an estimate of the likelihood of occurring of an event based on repeated trials. LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS Consider: Rolling a 1 of a die If the sample space of a random experiment consists of \\(n\\) equally likely outcomes and an event \\(E\\) consists of \\(m\\) of those outcomes, then \\[\\text {Theorerical Probability} : P(E) = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes in the event}(m)}{\\text{total number of outcomes}(n)}\\] Let \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) be the proportion of outcomes that are \\(1\\) after the \\(n\\) rolls. As the number of rolls \\((n)\\) increases, \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) (the relative frequency of rolls, or the experimental probability) will converge to the theoretical probability of rolling a \\(1,\\space p = 1/6.\\) The figure shows the convergence for \\(100,000\\) die rolls. The tendency of \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) to stabilize around \\(p\\), i.e. the tendency of the relative frequency to stabilize around the true probability, is described by the Law of Large Numbers. As more observations are collected, the observed proportion \\(\\hat{p_n}\\) of occurrences with a particular outcome after \\(n\\) trials converges to the true probability \\(p\\) of that outcome. Die Rolls Simulation The figure shows the fraction of die rolls that are \\(1\\) at each stage in a simulation. The relative frequency tends to get closer to the probability \\(1/6 \\approx 0.167\\) as the number of rolls increases. Example: Calculating Probabilities For a group of \\(10\\) students in one of the authors algebra classes, there are \\(2\\) nursing majors \\(\\textbf (N)\\), \\(4\\) business majors \\(\\textbf (B)\\), \\(1\\) architect \\(\\textbf (A)\\) major, and \\(3\\) undecided \\(\\textbf (U)\\) majors. None of the students are double-majors. Find \\(P(N)\\). Construct a frequency and relative frequency table of the students majors. Find \\(P(B), P(A)\\), and \\(P(U)\\). Find \\(P(\\text{philosophy})\\). Find the probability of randomly selecting a nursing, business, architect, OR undecided major. Find \\(P(N) + P(B) + P(A) + P(U)\\). Why does the result make sense? A random variable is a numerical measure of an outcome from a random experiment. We often use a capital letter such as X to stand for a random variable. Let X be the outcome of rolling a six-sided die once. Find the given probability. 1.\\(P(X=4)\\) 2.\\(P(X\\le 4)\\) 3.\\(P(X&gt;4)\\) 4.\\(P(3 \\le X \\le 6)\\) 5.2 Finding Probabilities This section presents the addition and multiplication rules of calculating probabilities. 5.2.1 Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes Two events or outcomes are called disjoint or mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen in the same trial. When rolling a die, the outcomes \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are disjoint, and we compute the probability that one of these outcomes will occur by adding their separate probabilities: \\[P(1 \\text{ or } 2)=P(1)+P(2)=1/6+1/6=1/3\\] What about the probability of rolling a \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\ or \\ 6\\) ? \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} P(1 \\text{ or } 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\text{ or } 4 \\text{ or } 5 \\text{ or }6) = P(1)+P(2)+P(3)+P(4)+P(5)+P(6) \\\\ =1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6 =1 \\end{array} \\] It is no surprise that the probability is \\(1\\), since it is certain that one of the six outcomes must occur. ADDITION RULE OF DISJOINT OUTCOMES If \\(A_1,...,A_k\\) represent \\(k\\) disjoint outcomes, then the probability that one of them occurs is given by: \\[P(A_1\\text{ or }A_2 \\text{ or ... or }A_k)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+...+P(A_k)\\] Example: Consider a standard deck of cards. \\[ \\text {4 suits} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{hearts: } \\color{red}{\\heartsuit} \\\\ \\text{diamonds: } \\color{red}{\\diamondsuit} \\\\ \\text{clubs: } \\spadesuit \\\\ \\text{spades: } \\clubsuit \\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[\\text{13 cards in each suit: } Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King\\] One card is dealt from a well shuffled deck. \\[ \\begin{align} P(\\text{the card is an ace or a king}) &amp;= P(\\text{it&#39;s an ace})+P(\\text {it&#39;s a king}) \\\\ &amp; = 4/52+4/52 \\\\ &amp; = 8/52 \\\\ &amp; = 2/13 \\end{align} \\] Venn Diagram - a diagram style to illustrate simple set relationships in probability.

Linear Transformation of Normal Curve | Standardizing with Z-Scores Consider a normally distributed random variable \\(x\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and sd \\(\\sigma\\): \\(x \\tilde \\space N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\) Two-step linear transformation of \\(x\\) subtract \\(\\mu\\) from \\(x\\) divide \\((x-\\mu)\\) by \\(\\sigma\\) \\[\\bbox[yellow,5px]{\\color{black}{\\text{standard normal deviate: } z = \\frac {x-\\mu}{\\sigma}}}\\] The Z-score of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean, then its Z-score is -1.5. Linear Transformation | Normal Curve to Standard Normal Curve \\[ \\bbox[yellow,5px] { \\color{black}{{\\text {Density at z}} = \\frac {1}{\\sqrt {2\\pi}}\\exp{-\\frac{1}{2}z^2}, -\\infty&lt;z&lt;+\\infty} } \\] Example: Compute and Interpret a \\(z\\)-Score The 2014 draft picks for NBA basketball teams have heights that are approximately normally distributed with mean 79.1 inches and standard deviation 3.0 inches (Source: nbadraft.net). Shabazz Napier was the shortest 2014 draft pick with a height of 72 inches. Find the z-score for 72 inches. What does it mean? \\[ z = \\frac {x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\\\ z = \\frac {72 - 79.1}{3} \\\\ z = - 2.37 \\] The z-score is 2.37, which means that Napiers height is 2.37 standard deviations less than the mean. Empirical Rules in terms of \\(z\\)-scores Because the z-score of an observation is the number of standard deviations that the observation is from the mean, we can restate the Empirical Rule in terms of \\(z\\)-scores. So, if a distribution is normally distributed, then \\(68\\%\\) of its z-scores lie between 1 and 1 \\(95\\%\\) of its z-scores lie between 2 and 2 \\(99.7\\%\\) of its z-scores lie between 3 and 3 Normal Probability Examples | z-score to percentile Cumulative SAT scores are approximated by a normal model with \\(\\mu = 1500 \\text { and } \\sigma = 300\\). What is the probability that a randomly selected SAT taker scores at least 1630 on the SAT? \\(z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}=\\frac{1630-1500}{300}=\\frac{130}{300}=0.43\\) \\(P(z\\ge0.43)=0.3336\\) The probability that a randomly selected score is at least 1630 on the SAT is 33%.

In this chapter, we will explore how to visually describe association between two quantitative variables using scatterplot. We will also introduce a method to measure linear association between those variables. 6.1 Univariate Data 6.2 Bivariate Data - Scatter Diagram Scatterplots exhibit the relationship between two numeric variables. They are used for detecting patterns, trends, and relationships. 6.3 Bivariate Data - Positive Association Unit of observation used in the plot is county. The plot shows positive association between education and income. 6.4 Linear Association between Variables Linear Association: the scatter diagram is clustered around a straight line Positive (Linear) Association: above average values of one variable tend to go with above average values of the other; scatterplot slopes up. Negative (Linear) Association: above average values of one variable tend to go with below average values of the other; scatterplot slopes down. No (Linear) Association: Scatterplot shows no direction 6.5 Correlation Coefficient Correlation coefficient: \\(\\lbrace r | -1 \\le r \\le +1 \\rbrace\\) It measures linear association, i.e. how tightly the points are clustered about a straight line. 6.6 Calculating Correlation Coefficient \\[ \\begin{array}{ccrrr} x &amp; y &amp; z_x &amp; z_y &amp; z_x \\cdot z_y \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1.414 &amp; -0.777 &amp; 1.098 \\\\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; -0.707 &amp; -0.291 &amp; 0.206 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1.262 &amp; 0 \\\\ 4 &amp; 6 &amp; 0.707 &amp; 1.165 &amp; 0.824 \\\\ 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 1.414 &amp; 1.165 &amp; 1.648 \\\\ \\hline \\\\ \\bar x = 3 &amp; \\bar y = 3.6 &amp; &amp; \\text{mean (Col 5)} &amp; r=0.755 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Formula for Correlation Coefficient \\(\\text {If the data are} \\space (x_i, y_i), 1\\le i\\le n, \\text {then}\\) \\[\\bbox[yellow,5px] { \\color{black}{r = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{x_i-\\mu_x}{\\sigma_x}\\right)\\left(\\frac{y_i-\\mu_y}{\\sigma_y}\\right)} } \\] 6.7 Properties of Correlation Coefficient \\(r\\) is a pure number with no units \\(-1\\le r\\le +1\\) Adding a constant to one of the variables does not affect \\(r\\) Multiplying one of the variables by a positive constant does not affect \\(r\\) Multiplying one of the variables by a negative constant switches the sign of \\(r\\) but does not affect the absolute value of \\(r\\) What correlation coefficient does not tell you? ASSOCIATION IS NOT CAUSATION. If two variables have a non-zero correlation, then they are related to each other in some way, but that does not mean that one causes the other. CORRELATION COEFFICIENT MEASURES LINEAR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES. Two variables appear to strongly associated, but \\(r\\) is close to \\(0\\). This is because the relationship is clearly nonlinear. \\(r\\) measures linear association. Dont use it if the scatter diagram is nonlinear. 6.8 Modeling Linear Association A linear model is a nonvertical line that describes the association between two quantities in an authentic situation The linear model allows us to estimate the value of the output or dependent variable \\((y)\\) for any value of the input or explanatory variable \\((x)\\). Errors in Estimation The error in an estimate is the amount by which the estimate differs from the actual value of \\(y\\), for a given value of \\(x\\). \\(\\text {error} = \\hat y_{est} - y_{obs}\\) For an overestimate, the error is positive. For an underestimate, the error is negative. Linear Model Examples 6.8.1 Intercepts of a Line An x-intercept of a line is a point where the line and the x-axis intersect.
